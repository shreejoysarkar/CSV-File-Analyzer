## üîç Problem Statement

Manually inspecting raw CSV files is often tedious and error-prone. This project aims to automate the initial analysis of any CSV file by:
- Displaying structural information (column names and data types)
- Previewing top and bottom records
- Counting unique values per column
- Exporting a cleaned version of the file for further analysis
